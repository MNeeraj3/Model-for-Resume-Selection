## Problem Statement:

Build a Machine Learning model , which will help the management to Identify the potential candidates (good candidate to offer job) for both the roles (Web Development and Data Scientist) from the given data.

## Solution Approch:

* Since it is unlabbeled data, I am approching by unsuperwise Algorithms
* For Other Skill to take into the model, doing text analysis
* Splitting the Other Skill into core skills of Data Science and Web Developement
* Providing the Weight to Given skills, Other Skills and Academics
* Using K-mean clustering to make clusters
## Output Insight
* Candidate for Data Science & Web Dev both: 58 out of 392
* Candidate for Data Science: 82 out of 392
* Candidate for Web Developer: 107 out of 392
* Candidates that are Not Eligible: 145 out of 392
